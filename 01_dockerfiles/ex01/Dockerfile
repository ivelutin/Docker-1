# From a debian image you will add the appropriate sources to create a
# TeamSpeak server, that will launch along with your container.
# It will be deemed valid if at least one user can connect to it and engage
# in a normal discussion (no far-fetched setup), so be sure to create your
# Dockerfile with the right options. Your program should get the sources when
# it builds, they cannot be in your repository.
